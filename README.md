# Penning Labs
## Welcome
Welcome to Penning Labs a hub for software applications crafted by me, Matthew Penning. The first application is lxconsole. This is a porting of my software application LXD Dashboard from PHP to Python. It is currently is a beta testing phase.
## Lxconsole
This application is a web-based graphical console application that interacts with the LXD api, providing a management interface capable of controlling multiple LXD servers from a single interface.
